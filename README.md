## Introduction

Speech recognition is the process of converting spoken words into text. In this project, we focus on recognizing spoken digits (0-9) using deep learning techniques. We utilize MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features extracted from audio samples as inputs to a CNN model. The CNN learns to classify the spoken digits based on these features.
